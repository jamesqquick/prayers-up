<p class="lead">Prayers Up is a sample project I created to reinforce my learning from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> online course I took on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>.  I took this course as my first real deep dive into Web Development.  It focused on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.  For what it's worth, I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to dig into Web Development.  The course was created by an amazing teacher, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/">Colte Steele</a>.</p>
